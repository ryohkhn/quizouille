# Quizouille

This Android application is designed to assist users in learning various subjects such as foreign language vocabulary, mathematical formulas, historical dates, etc. It offers a unique approach to learning through a question-and-answer format, where each subject is presented as a separate set of questions to ensure focused learning.  

## Features

### Adaptive Learning Algorithm: 

Each question starts at Level 1. Upon correct answer, its level is incremented; if answered incorrectly, it resets to Level 1. This spaced repetition system ensures efficient learning.  

### Customizable Question Sets: 
Users can engage with a variety of topics, each with its unique set of questions and answers, stored in a database.  

### Flexible Question Types: 
Questions are primarily text-based. Users must provide the exact or nearly exact text of the answer. There is also an option for multiple-choice questions.  

### Spaced Repetition Scheduling: 
Questions are revisited at intervals depending on their level â€“ daily for Level 1, every two days for Level 2, every four days for Level 3, and so on. This technique enhances memory retention.  

### Scalable Design: 
The app is capable of handling an unlimited number of question sets, each containing an arbitrary number of questions.
